The Python code in this depository can be used for air quality sensors assembled using a Raspberry Pi.

The specific sensors used:
- BME280: https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/bme280-breakout?variant=29420960677971
- SCD30: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4867
- PMS5003: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3686

The following files were used:
- run.py file contains code to run the Raspberry Pi and the sesnors to obtain measurements for the air quality.
- Pressures.py contains code to obtain outdoor pressure at a chosen location.
- analysis.py contains code for analysing and plotting the obtained data.

The file 3D_design.step contains the 3D printable case for the setup.
